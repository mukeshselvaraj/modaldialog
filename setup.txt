I tried the above & not able to implement the feature as the way we discussed.
So, I did a lot of research in identifying the easier & rapid development, I made use of a library been used by the Angular core team.
Also, getting an approval from PNG team for this approval is trivial as its Angular core library & its not a 3rd party library
So, If you need just let know will get the licensed version of this library as I got approvals for several libraries earlier from PNG team.
Also, its not an complicated issue to discuss about this prolonged.
But, if you feel its bit tricky, then am free to hear your better suggestions.
