What we initially discussed is that you have asked me to create a modal dialog as you are not able to handle events
For that, I suggested you to create a reusable modal dialog for handling this scenario.
And furthermore, I only suggested you that we can try to implement this with Kendo library.
But due to some inherent issues, we can't implement this functionality in full fledge.

Yesterday, I have elaborated and very much explained you in detail that it will consume lot of time and effort if we need to achieve this by using BootStrap & it will be something equivalent to creatina component from scratch.
So, you have asked me to move the code to a file to achieve this feature & then I agreed to do in that way.
