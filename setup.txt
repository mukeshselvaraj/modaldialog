What we initially discussed is that you have asked me to create a modal dialog as you are not able to handle events
For that, I suggested you to create a reusable modal dialog for handling this scenario.
And furthermore, I only suggested you that we can try to implement this with Kendo library.
But due to some inherent issues, we can't implement this functionality in full fledge.
